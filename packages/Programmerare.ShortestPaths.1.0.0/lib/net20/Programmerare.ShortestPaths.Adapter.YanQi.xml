            Note that currently there seem to be no way for the "yanqi" implementation to actually specify the number 
            of shortest paths to return, but it seems to find all paths.
            However, the implementation of this method instead takes care of reducing the result.
            Otherwise, if the semantic of the method is not respected it can not for example be tested 
            against results from other implementations since then they would return a different number of paths.
